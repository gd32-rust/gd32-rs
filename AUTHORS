# This is the list of gd32-rs's significant contributors.
#
# This does not necessarily list everyone who has contributed code, especially since many employees
# of one corporation may be contributing. To see the full list of contributors, see the revision
# history in source control. In particular, much of the code is based on the stm32-rs repository,
# so the various contributors to that are also authors of this crate.
